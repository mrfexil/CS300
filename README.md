**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The projects aimed to implement data structures to manage and process bid data. 
The objective was to analyze various methods to identify the most suitable solution that meets the requirements while ensuring efficient execution.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
To address the problem, I analyzed the operational requirements of storing, retrieving, and removing bids and evaluated the suitability of hash tables, vectors, and binary search trees based on their performance.
I selected hash tables as the optimal choice because they enable near-instantaneous lookups and removals by using unique bid IDs as keys, ensuring efficiency for large datasets. 
Understanding data structures is important, as each serves as a specialized tool:
vectors act like a sequential list, requiring slow searches;
binary search trees organize data for ordered access but are slower for lookups;
and hash tables provide a fast, scalable solution for key-based retrieval, making them ideal for this projectâ€™s need for quick, reliable data management.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
Throughout the course, I encountered issues with IDE, as I needed code that can translate past operating systems since I had difficulties getting the program to read the CSV file.
However, in the project, I learned about how to properly configure and place the files in the appropriate locations to ensure proper reading.
The solution first looked like local configuration, which was going to result in hard coding since CVS parsing was not used in the project. 
However, after some research (and a poor grade on an assignment), I discovered how to configure the program to work in multiple IDEs, resulting in being able to create the program in a single file.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
While working on the project, it deepened my approach to software design by emphasizing the need to balance functionality with efficiency and adaptability. 
I learned that effective coding involves understanding trade-offs, such as choosing data structures based on performance needs and resource constraints. 
This required analyzing and planning solutions that optimize computing resources.
The iterative process of addressing issues constantly taught me the value of careful design and continuous revision to deliver a robust, effective product that meets both functional and environmental requirements.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
The project taught me to write clearer code by adding minimal, targeted error handling and initializing variables to avoid warnings, improving readability. 
Also, to plan out multiple methods before fixating on one specific way, as some plans sound great on paper but terrible when executed.
